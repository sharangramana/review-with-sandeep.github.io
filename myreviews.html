                <p>Violence in cinema is not something which is shown through gore and brutality.
                    Ambience,mood and anticipation must be created while staging a scene and it should make the audience 
                    wait for that "Outburst".QT does this with ease and this is one such scene where the scenario could have 
                    ended very smooth as per planned by the characters but this one ends on a high note with a rampage.
                    "Inglourious Basterds" is filled with scenes where outburst occurs in most unlikely scenarios and it 
                    introduced me to the world of ruthlessness.</p>

                <p>In a war prone world a little fantasy is something that gives you Hope ‚ù§ 
                    Pan's Labyrinth strikes you hard with it's flow and approach on this universal disease.
                    This is a Very beautifully written and shot film</p>

                <p>"The Jewish hatred among the Germans" is something that everyone needs to know,
                    pain and fear is what that remained constant during Hitler's inhumane reign.
                    There has been number of movies which talks about this in an elaborative way now coming to 
                    "Jo Jo Rabbit" Jewish hatred in a naive kid's heart has been captured with authenticity by taika 
                    and what's that kid going through has been pictured with it's original essence.
                    Hitler eating unicorn for dinner in little Jo Jo's halucination is a scene where the writing 
                    proved to be praise worthy ! </p>
